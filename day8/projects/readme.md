# Ceasar Cipher

Create a program to can encode/decode a message.

### rules:
- The user can encode or decode based on an input
- The user can choose a number to 'scramble' the cypher

<strong>eg:</strong>  
- the string <strong>'abc'</strong> with a shift of 1 will result in <strong>'bcd'</strong> when encoding
- the string <strong>'bcd'</strong> with a shift of 1 will result in <strong>'abc'</strong> when encoding

<strong>Notes:</strong>
Be cautions about getting out of bond with endexes for the letter z with a shift of 2 (encode) and letter b with a shift of 5 (decode)
